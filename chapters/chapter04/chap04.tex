\chapter{Multi-Objective Multi-Armed Bandit}
\label{chap:momab}

\initial{M}ulti-armed bandits is a machine learning paradigm used to study and analyze resource allocation in stochastic and uncertain environments. The multi-armed bandit problem that considers reward vectors and imports techniques from multi-objective optimization into the multi-armed bandits algorithms is referred to as multi-objective multi-armed bandits(MOMAB). In this chapter, we first introduce the MOO's problem,after that, we will talk about the MOMAB.
