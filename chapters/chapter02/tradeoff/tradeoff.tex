\section{The strategy of trade-off}
\label{sec:tradeoff}

The synopsis of Bandit problems have been introduced in Section~\ref{sec:environment}. From this synopsis, we get the difficult point of Bandit problem is to keep a balance between Exploration and Exploitation. So that, it becomes very important to trade off between to exploit from the past knowledge to focus on the arms that seems to yield the highest rewards and to explore further the other arms to identify that better which may be the actual global optimal. 

The easiest way to solve this problem, is to select randomly. However, this way mainly relies on luck. So it is not reliable. Another simple way is called ``Naive Sampling'' approach. At early times, it samples each arm by same number, and then measure the results on comparing these samples. After that, an optimal empirical solution has been shown. But this approach also has a problem, that is, if the initial number of samples is too small, the confidence will be low; if the initial number are huge enough, will waste the cost. Therefore, in this section, we will introduce some effective strategies to solve bandit problems.
